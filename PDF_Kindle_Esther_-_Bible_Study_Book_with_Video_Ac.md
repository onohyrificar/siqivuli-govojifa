Overview
A beautiful queen, her courageous cousin, a foreign land, and a murderous adversaryâ€”the book of Esther has all the elements of an epic drama. The story unfolds at a time when the people of God are split between nations with an uncertain future. While the name of God may not be mentioned in the book of Esther, its pages highlight His work among His people and foreshadow Jesusâ€™s very ministry to usâ€”darkness to light, mourning to celebration, death to life. In this 7-session study, Kelly Minter invites you into the daring faith modeled by Esther and her cousin Mordecaiâ€”a faith developed over time, rooted in the goodness of God, lived out through extraordinary circumstances, and used to change the world. Although our time looks different from Estherâ€™s, our God is just as active and faithful today, and He has called you for such a time as this.

Understand how the book of Esther fits into Godâ€™s redemptive story. Be reminded that God is always at work in every place and at all times, and is faithful to His promises. See how God uses faithful men and women working together to accomplish His redemptive purposes in the world. Video Sessions: Session One: Introduction (22:47)â€”In this opening video, Kelly teaches on the historical and cultural context of the book of Esther. The book of Esther tells the history of Godâ€™s people after the exile, specifically those who stayed in Persia. Through the accounts of this book, we see Godâ€™s faithfulness to His people everywhere and at all times. Session Two: Welcome to the Empire (35:03)â€”Teaching through Esther 1, Kelly describes the oppressive life in the Persian empire and draws modern parallels to the spirit of empire in our world today. The realities of life in our broken world stir in us a longing for Godâ€™s kingdom, for the humble and kind nature of King Jesus. Session Three: Godâ€™s People in Faraway Places (39:20)â€”Kellyâ€™s teaching through Esther 2â€“3 highlights the profound truth that God does not forget His people. He will bless His people wherever they are and use them to accomplish His will. Session Four: For Such a Time as This (32:52)â€”The events in Esther 4 highlight how God can use us in big ways to impact His kingdom. Kelly challenges us to open our eyes to what He wants to do in and through us for His glory and for the good of others. Session Five: In Between Two Banquets (38:49)â€”In this video session, Kelly reflects on the remarkable truth that God is the only One truly in control, as we see through His work in Esther 5â€“6. Weâ€™re challenged to rest in His sovereign care, and to cast our care on Him. Session Six: A Great Reversal (36:18)â€”In Esther 7â€“8, we see Esther put her life on the line and make great sacrifices for Godâ€™s people. As a result, she transforms; she goes from being someone living for the temporary pleasures of the palace to living for God and His kingdom. Kelly reminds us that through Jesus, this reversal is true in each of our lives. Session Seven: A Great Celebration (29:44)â€”Through the close of the book of Esther, we see that God was just as faithful to the Jews who stayed in Persia as to those who returned home. Kelly closes her study with the reminder that we, too, can have confidence in Godâ€™s faithfulness to us, and this is cause for great celebration.

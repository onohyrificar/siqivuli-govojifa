Overview
Explore the dark side of Davidson Countyâ€™s past.
 
After killing his brother-in-law in 1904, wealthy businessman Henry Clay Grubb of the Churchland community was himself killed in 1913. In 1918 an adulterous affair led Graham Hege to kill his best friend, Frank Deaderick. Though most perpetrators were caught, if not convicted, the identity of the murderer of Sarah Holland Springs remains a mystery to this day. These twelve stories explore the shadowy side of this portion of the Piedmont.
 
 Join author Caleb Sink, a lifelong resident of Davidson County, on his quest to uncover two centuries of secrets.

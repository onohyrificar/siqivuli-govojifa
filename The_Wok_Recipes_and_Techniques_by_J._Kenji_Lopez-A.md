Notes From Your Bookseller The talent behind the bestselling The Food Lab returns with a culinary/scientific exploration of the world&#039;s most popular cooking pan. As a proponent of molecular gastronomy, Lopez-Alt has blended science with art to explain why recipes work, but he leavens the facts with an engaging writing style that has brought him fans everywhere. One of Time&#039;s 10 Most Anticipated Cookbooks of 2022

 The obsessive mastermind behind one of the decadeâ€™s best-selling cookbooks returns with the definitive English-language guide to the science and technique of cooking in a wok.
 J. Kenji LÃ³pez-Altâ€™s debut cookbook, The Food Lab, revolutionized home cooking, selling more than half a million copies with its science-based approach to everyday foods. And for fast, fresh cooking for his family, thereâ€™s one pan LÃ³pez-Alt reaches for more than any other: the wok. Whether stir-frying, deep frying, steaming, simmering, or braising, the wok is the most versatile pan in the kitchen. Once you master the basicsâ€”the mechanics of a stir-fry, and how to get smoky wok hei at homeâ€”youâ€™re ready to cook home-style and restaurant-style dishes from across Asia and the United States, including Kung Pao Chicken, Pad Thai, and San Franciscoâ€“Style Garlic Noodles. LÃ³pez-Alt also breaks down the science behind beloved Beef Chow Fun, fried rice, dumplings, tempura vegetables or seafood, and dashi-simmered dishes. Featuring more than 200 recipesâ€”including simple no-cook sidesâ€”explanations of knife skills and how to stock a pantry, and more than 1,000 color photographs, The Wok provides endless ideas for brightening up dinner.
